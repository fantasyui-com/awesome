***Kosmos***
***by Walt Whitman***

    Who includes diversity and is Nature,

    Who is the amplitude of the earth, and the coarseness and sexuality of the earth,
    and the great charity of the earth and the equilibrium also,

    Who has not look’d forth from the windows the eyes for nothing,
    or whose brain held audience with messengers for nothing,

    Who contains believers and disbelievers, who is the most majestic lover,

    Who holds duly his or her triune proportion of realism, spiritualism,
    and of the æsthetic or intellectual,

    Who having consider’d the body finds all its organs and parts good,

    Who, out of the theory of the earth and of his or her body
    understands by subtle analogies all other theories,

    The theory of a city, a poem, and of the large politics of these States;

    Who believes not only in our globe with its sun and moon,
    but in other globes with their suns and moons,

    Who, constructing the house of himself or herself,
    not for a day but for all time, sees races, eras, dates, generations,

    The past, the future, dwelling there, like space, inseparable together.

## If
***By Rudyard Kipling***

    If you can keep your head when all about you
        Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
    If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
        But make allowance for their doubting too;
    If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
        Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,
    Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,
        And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:

    If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
        If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
    If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
        And treat those two impostors just the same;
    If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken
        Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
    Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
        And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:

    If you can make one heap of all your winnings
        And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
    And lose, and start again at your beginnings
        And never breathe a word about your loss;
    If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
        To serve your turn long after they are gone,
    And so hold on when there is nothing in you
        Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’

    If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
        Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
    If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
        If all men count with you, but none too much;
    If you can fill the unforgiving minute
        With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,
    Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,
        And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!
